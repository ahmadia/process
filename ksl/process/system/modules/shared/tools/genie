"This module enables genie-mode (aggressive environment management).

When this module is loaded, the module command will attempt to
manipulate very common variable names such as CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS,
LDFLAGS so that system tools like autoconf and make have a better
chance at correctly compiling your code.  You must load this BEFORE
any other modules.

WARNING: This module is experimental and, although it attempts to make
your life easier, it will probably fail in spectacular and
unpredictable ways.  Use at your own peril.

And don't say we didn't warn you."
