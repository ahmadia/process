Description: Automation tools for high performance computing
environments. kslrun - front-end script for submitting jobs to the
LoadLeveler scheduling environment kslinstall - a unified
configuration, build, and environment (using module) management tool
for third-party libraries on supercomputing systems So far these tools
are specific to our BlueGene/P+LoadLeveler Shaheen installation at
KAUST Supercomputing Laboratories, but I am interested in helping
migrate them to other environments.
