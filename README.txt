Description:
Automation tools for high performance computing environments. kslrun - front-end script for submitting jobs to the LoadLeveler scheduling environment kslinstall - a unified configuration, build, and environment (using module) management tool for third-party libraries on supercomputing systems So far these tools are specific to our BlueGene/P+LoadLeveler Shaheen installation at KAUST Supercomputing Laboratories, but I am interested in helping migrate them to other environments.
