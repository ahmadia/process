base.description=\
"""LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a software library for numerical
linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear
equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular
value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the
associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur
decomposition. LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77 and is now
written in Fortran 90. The routines handle both real and complex
matrices in both single and double precision.

Heavily used in high-performance computing, a highly optimized
implementations of the LAPACK interface is available on Shaheen
through IBM's ESSL implementation with patches contributed by the PDC
at KTH.
